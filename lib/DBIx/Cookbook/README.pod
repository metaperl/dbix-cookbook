=head1 NAME

DBIx::Cookbook::README -- structure of the lib/DBIx/Cookbook directory

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In the F<lib/DBIx/Cookbook>, there are several types of
files/directories: 

=head2 Command classes

These classes leverage L<MooseX::App::Cmd> and serve as the command
class for the scripts in F<$DISTRO/scripts> to run actual
commands. Let's make that concrete.

The file L<dbic_cmd
script|http://github.com/metaperl/dbix-cookbook/blob/master/scripts/dbic_cmd>
invokes F<lib/DBIx/Cookbook/DBIC.pm> which then invokes one of the
"scripts" in F<lib/DBIx/Cookbook/*.pm> to run a particular command.

A similar execution flow exists for Rose::DB::Object through
F<rdbo_cmd>, F<lib/DBIx/Cookbook/RDBO.pm> and
F<lib/DBIx/Cookbook/RDBO/*.pm> as well as 
F<skinny_cmd>, F<lib/DBIx/Cookbook/Skinny.pm> and
F<lib/DBIx/Cookbook/Skinny/*.pm>


=head2 Database connectivity files

F<lib/DBIx/Cookbook/DBH.(tt|pm)> are files which hold database
connection info. When C<make sakila> is run during package
installation, the F<.tt> file is turned into the F<.pm> file via the
L<install sakila
script|http://github.com/metaperl/dbix-cookbook/blob/master/etc/install_sakila.pl> 
=head2 Recipe directories

F<RecipeTT> and F<Recipe> are the directories for templates and
generated pod for the recipes. 


=head1 That's all folks

So now you know about all the files in the
L<lib/DBIx/Cookbook|http://github.com/metaperl/dbix-cookbook/tree/master/lib/DBIx/Cookbook/>
directory
