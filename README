DBIx-Cookbook is an executable cookbook of code for Perl ORMs.

It is based on the [Sakila database
schema](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila.html). Currently,
the majority of code is for
[DBIx::Class](http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class) 
but all ORMs are encouraged to contribute code so that comparisons can
be made between various ORMs for the same task.

The primary documentation for the project can be read on
[CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Cookbook/lib/DBIx/Cookbook.pm).
